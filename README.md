# thoughts-source
These files are used to build a static site in hugo.
See my customizations to the *detox* template in layouts/partials

- to run on your local, use `hugo server`     
- to update changes on the host, run `hugo` and copy the public folder to the thoughts folder. You can then commit changes from there.
